  Hello, my name is Yoojin Kim, and also Lucia. 
  <br><br>
  I am a Master student at Music and Audio Computing Lab, Graduate School of Culture Technology, KAIST.
  Before joining the lab, I received a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Yonsei University, and minor was Child and Family Studies.
  <br><br>
  I'm intereseted in research topics about Data Analytics, Music Information Retrieval, and their intersections with various aspects of human life.
  <br><br>
  Currently I'm working intensively on Emotional Symbolic Music Data Analysis, and I mostly use Machine Learning and Deep Learning for my research.
  For a full history of my career, you can refer to my <a href="/assets/files/cv_20201001.pdf"> CV<I>(last update in Oct 2020)</I></a> .

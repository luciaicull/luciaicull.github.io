  Hello, my name is Yoojin Kim, and also Lucia. 
  <br><br>
  I am a Master student at Music and Audio Computing Lab, Graduate School of Culture Technology, KAIST.
  Before joining the lab, I received a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Yonsei University, and minor was Child and Family Studies.
  <br><br>
  I'm intereseted in research topics about Data Analytics, Music Information Retrieval, and their intersection with various aspects of human life.
  <br><br>
  Currently I'm working intensively on Emotional Symbolic Music Data Analysis. You can find more details about my projects below.
  For a full history of my career, you can refer to my <a href="/assets/files/cv_20201001.pdf"> CV</a> <I>(last update in Oct 2020)</I>.
